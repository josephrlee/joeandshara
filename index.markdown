    Parking can be tough around Green Lake, so it’s a good idea to come early! To make things a bit easier, we’ve reserved the parking lots at Seattle Formosan Christian Church 333 NE 76th St. You can also pay for parking under PCC grocery.

  ##### A note to our friends with kids:

  Due to limited seating at the venue, we've decided to make our wedding an adult-only event. We hope this advance notice means you're still able to celebrate our big day and you'll enjoy having the evening off! (Our exceptions: Guests traveling from out of town are welcome to bring their kids, and guests with very young infants are also welcome.)
