  ##### A note to our friends with kids:

  Due to limited seating at the venue, we've decided to make our wedding an (mostly) adult-only event. We hope this advance notice means you're still able to celebrate our big day and you'll enjoy having the evening off!

  <i>Some exceptions to the rule: Families traveling from out of town are welcome to bring their children. If you have a newborn, we're eager to meet them at the wedding!</i>

  Please don't hesitate to contact us if you have questions.
