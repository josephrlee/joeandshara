  ##### A note to our friends with kids:

  Due to limited seating at the venue, we've decided to make our wedding an adult-only event. We hope this advance notice means you're still able to celebrate our big day and you'll enjoy having the evening off! (Our exceptions: Guests traveling from out of town are welcome to bring their kids, and guests with very young infants are also welcome.)

  If you're traveling from out of town and would like to stay at a hotel, we recommend staying at [University Inn](http://www.universityinnseattle.com/) or [Watertown Hotel](http://www.watertownseattle.com/). Both are a short 10 minute drive away from our wedding venue, [Great Hall at Green Lake](https://goo.gl/maps/4BZfy8oDGy12). Use the code **WED** to get a discounted rate on your room.

  We also highly recommend using [Airbnb](https://www.airbnb.com/) , to find a unique place that suits your needs. If it's your first time using Airbnb, [sign up here](https://www.airbnb.com/c/sliou11) for $30 off.
